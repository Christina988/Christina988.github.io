    <h1> A Lily or a Nightshade - Details Page</h1>
    <p> This project uses a poem that I wrote a couple years ago. A Lily or a Nightshade describes how two 
        things that seem similar on the outside can actually be vastly different, such as two flowers while 
        one is deadly. The images I used reflect each part of the poem and sets a scene for it as well. </p>
        <p> I used stickpng.com for sourcing all of my images to usein this project. I used vecteezy.com for the
        nightshade image on the third page.</p>

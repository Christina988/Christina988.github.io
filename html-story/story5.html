    <p>I gasped and its head whipped around to face me, the eye sockets empty and black. How could it see me? Did it 
        see at all, or just hear? It seemed to consider its options, and I stayed as silent as I could, but it slowly 
        got up off of its haunches, keeping its head turned towards me. The moonlight glinted off of the blood that 
        dripped from its jaw, a long tongue flicked out and licked the blood off of its muzzle. I won’t let it get to 
        my kids. I aimed my gun at its head, willing my hands to stop shaking. It started coming towards me, the antlers
        scraping the ceiling creating an ominous sound. I aimed, and pulled the trigger.
    <p>Five.
	<p>I missed. I immediately yanked the hammer back and pulled the trigger again.
    <p>Four. </p>

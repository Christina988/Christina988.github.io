    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 8</h1>
    <p style= color:#eafff6;>I had just entered the forest, making sure to keep a line of trees between me and the beast. As it barreled towards me, it knocked down the trees in its way. 
	<p style= color:#eafff6;>“Oh Jesus Christ. I can’t outrun it!” I pulled the hammer back on my gun, spun around while running backwards, and aimed at its head and shot.
		<p>Two.
	<p style= color:#eafff6;>It hit its shoulder instead. It staggered a bit and slowed but it was still gaining distance on me, so I took the opportunity and aimed at its thigh. I slowed down so that I could aim properly, and I took the shot.
	<p style= color:#eafff6;>	One.
	<p style= color:#eafff6;>It had gained on me, but the bullet hit right where I wanted it to. The beast stumbled forward, but during its fall it slashed my left arm with its massive claws and I fell with it. The beast and I smashed into the ground at the same time. I fell on my butt and tried to scramble away from the thing, but it reached out and grabbed my calf, its claws ripped my flesh as I struggled out of its grasp and I shrieked. 
<p style= color:#eafff6;>I quickly got up and started running again. 
	Adrenaline rushed through my veins. 
<p style= color:#eafff6;>The kids. I needed to keep them safe. 
It took its time getting up. I wiped at my face as I ran.

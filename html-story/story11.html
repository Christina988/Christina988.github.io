    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 11</h1>
    <p>“Thank god.” I sighed. “The kids will be ok. I need to get back to them, but-” My head sagged as I saw my 
            injuries. “I won’t make it. Will they ever find me out here?”
	<p>My head started spinning from the loss of blood. With the last of my energy, I dragged my blood-soaked finger 
            through the slush to write out ‘I love you Maria, Oliver.’ I let my arms drop and the gun fell out of my 
            hand, empty. I looked back at my path from the house, my breath becoming uneven and shallow. 
<p>“They’re safe. They’re safe.” I repeat like a mantra, but I hear a sound in the far distance. Too similar to the 
        roar that creature made to be anything else.
<p>Nonetheless, darkness closes in on my vision, still looking to the house.

    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 9</h1>
    <p style= color:#eafff6;>The forest was dark, with the occasional moonlight filtering in, and the trees resembled looming demons. My body
		ached and the cold air cut into my lungs. I held my injured arm to my stomach which caused my side to cramp, and 
		my calf was burning regardless of the chill. I could feel my blood freezing my pants to my leg around the gash in
		my calf. I weaved between trees and raced across an iced over river the best I could. It tried to cross the river
		but its hooves gave it even less traction than I had. I hid behind a tree on the other side to catch my breath. 
		My huffs formed clouds in front of my face, the moisture freezing on my nose. I waited as I heard the beast using
		its claws to drag itself across the ice, and before I knew it, it was on my side and it was silent.
	<p style= color:#eafff6;>The branches swayed in the wind and it listened for me. I heard it walk away and I felt immense relief. I was 
		safe at last.

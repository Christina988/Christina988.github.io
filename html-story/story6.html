    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 6</h1>
    <p style= color:#eafff6;>I missed again. The creature was startled by the noise, but by the second shot it had recovered and was lunging 
        at me. I ducked behind the wall and cocked the gun again while running back into the kitchen. It came barreling
        around the corner into the hallway, and I aimed at its chest this time. I pulled the trigger.
		<p style= color:#eafff6;>Three.
	<p style= color:#eafff6;>It hit left of center and it went straight through its chest. The thing staggered back and fell to its knees but
        was very much still alive. I ran the other way and barreled through the kitchen and into the living room. 
        Behind me, I heard its hooves pound against the tile and some shattered. 
	<p style= color:#eafff6;>“Oh my god oh my god.” I kept running. Adrenaline shot through my limbs and I rounded back around into the foyer.
        I shot a look over my shoulder, which was a mistake because I saw that looming figure tearing after me. Its 
        form backlit by the living room lamps and I couldn’t make out any of its features. I ran past the gory mess of 
        flesh and bones, nothing was left of our sweet puppy.

    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 1</h1>
    <p>I was making dinner for my kids when it came. Our dog, Velvet, started barking at the front door and I asked my 
        eldest, Maria, to see why. Maria had left the room and then there was a loud crash and Velvet stopped barking 
        abruptly, accompanied by a shriek from Maria. 
        <p>“Mom! Mom!” She came sprinting back into the kitchen, blood splattered on her purple nightgown, and a 
            horrified look on her face.

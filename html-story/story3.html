    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 3</h1>
    <p>“You two, go out back and hide in your tree house. Call the police, tell them someone armed and dangerous broke 
            into the house.” I handed Oliver my phone because Maria was shaking. He nodded. I had given him a mission 
            and he was determined to complete it at all costs. 
    <p>“It’s not a person, Mom! That thing can’t possibly be human!” She was whispering, still conscious that there was 
        something, person or animal, in the other room. 
    <p>“Hush!” I glared. “Go outside. I won’t ask again. I will take care of this. I’ll be fine.” Oliver started dragging 
        her by the arm in the other direction, towards the back door and Maria was crying even harder now. She halted 
        in the doorway, pleading for me not to go, and I said, “I promise,” and she went reluctantly. All I could think 
        about was that the kids would be safe. The tree house was sealed and had a space heater in it. I turned my focus 
        back on the door way and I heard the back door softly open and close. Now that it was silent, I could hear the 
        faint sound of something crunching and ripping. </p>

    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 4</h1>
    <p style= color:#eafff6;>I mumbled to myself, “What the hell?” Then it dawned on me. Velvet. She was still there and was hit by the door. 
        Whatever person or animal was in there was eating our dog. Thank god the kids didn’t hear it, because my stomach 
        was churning. I swore under my breath and creeped towards the doorway with my gun raised, my footsteps silent, 
        the sound padded by the rubber soles of my boots. I turned off the stove, not breaking eye contact with the inky 
        black of the hall. I paused and let my eyes adjust to the darkness, still listening to the sickening crunch as 
        it chewed on the bones of our pet. I felt sick.
<p style= color:#eafff6;>My eyes adjusted fairly quickly, just enough to make out a silhouette, basked in the moonlight that streamed in from 
    the missing door and windows. It wasn’t a full moon, but it was bright enough to see. 
<p style= color:#eafff6;>Maria was right. This wasn’t human, and it wasn’t a bear. It was hunched over Velvet’s body, though its shadow didn’t
    allow me to see her. Its skeleton-thin frame was covered in fur and had huge hind legs, its long, thin tail swished 
    against the floor before it curled around its hooves. Its arms were unnaturally long, brandishing claws roughly the
    size of my hand. It sported massive antlers that hit the chain of the ceiling fan that hung on my 10 ft ceilings, 
    and when it ripped a chunk of meat off and slung its head back to gulp it down, the antlers hit the fan blades. Its
    face wasn’t gaunt, it was a skull. It looked deer-like but there was no skin, no meat, no fur, to cover the bare 
    bone. Is this thing the reason for the missing hikers and kids the locals warned me about?

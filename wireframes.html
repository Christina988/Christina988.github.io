        <h1>Wireframe Designs </h1>
     <p style=padding-bottom:40px>This page hosts a few designs of wireframes for a website. I made them using draw.io</p>   
    <div> <img src=Images/wireframehomepage.png 
            alt="Home Page Wireframe"
            width="300px" height="auto">
        </div>
        <p style=padding-bottom:60px> This is the wireframe I created to showcase the home page design. I wanted to keep the top bar for essential information,
          and then add a few more areas to click on to get the user to other pages.</p>

           <div> <img src=Images/wireframeindex.png 
            alt="Index Page Wireframe"
            width="300px" height="auto">
        </div>
      <p style=padding-bottom:60px> This one shows my index page design. I kept the top bar the same and laid out each link in a grid-like pattern.
        This is so that users can easily see all of the links and it isn't cluttered.</p>

   <div> <img src=Images/wireframeaboutme.png 
            alt="About Me Page Wireframe"
            width="300px" height="auto">
        </div>
<p style=padding-bottom:60px> This one is for my about me page. I used some stand in text for the actual about me part since this is about the layout rather than the content.
  This one, I wanted to be simple, straightforward, and easy to read.</p> 
      
 <div> <img src=Images/wireframemywork.png 
            alt="My Work Page Wireframe"
            width="300px" height="auto">
        </div>
<p style=padding-bottom:60px> This design is for the my work page, or projects page. It would show my top 4 favorite projects to bounce around to. It doesn't show every work, 
  but I would add a link on each work's page to go back to the index or to the Top 4 projects page. Which, I might rename it to favorite projects.</p>
      
 <div> <img src=Images/wireframe404.png 
            alt="404 Page Wireframe"
            width="300px" height="auto">
        </div>
<p style=padding-bottom:60px> This one is for my 404 page. Ithas the same top bar and color scheme. It is straight forward and tells the user that they reached
  a not quite finished area. It also provides them with a link back to the home page so they can get back on the right track.</p>

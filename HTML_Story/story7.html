    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 7</h1>
    <p>I ran out of the open doorway onto our front patio. As I ran by I grabbed a long stick that was leaning against 
            the doorway. I ran through the door of the patio and it came out of the house behind me so fast it burst 
            through the metal framing and into the snowy yard. 
	<p>I needed to get this thing away from the kids. It was standing eerily still, listening for any sign of me. I held
            my breath and then the creature roared. It was deeper than the sound of a bear and it was much, much louder.
            So loud the trees near it shook and snow pummeled to the ground. I waited as it listened for me. I threw 
            the stick as hard as I could and it landed past the creature. As soon as it hit the ground, the creature 
            lunged for it and I ran in the opposite direction.

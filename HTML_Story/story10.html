    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 10</h1>
    <p>I sat down against the tree, and a deer came barreling past me. My heart started pounding again. It’s still here.
            It’s waiting for me. Has it already found me? I scanned the trees from where the deer came from and waited,
            my gun aimed out in front of me. I had one bullet left. I waited, and listened. I heard a thud to the left
            and aimed in that direction, but the beast launched itself from behind a tree to the right. I swung my gun
            to aim at its head and I waited until it got closer. I needed to hit it. Everything seemed to slow down. It
            was rushing at me but it seemed to move slowly. It was almost on me now. I aimed up, and shot. The bullet 
            went straight through its skull and it toppled head first into my lap. It smelled tangy like blood but it 
            also smelled rotten. Its empty sockets stared up at me and its body was cold and motionless. I sighed in 
            relief. Then, I heard sirens in the distance.

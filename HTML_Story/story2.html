    <h1>Dead of Night - Page 2</h1>
    <p>“What happened?” I asked. I dropped the wooden spoon and grabbed the hand gun out of the drawer. I loaded the 
            bullets in, cocked it then pointed it at the ground. I positioned myself in front of Maria and her younger 
            brother, Oliver. Maria was hugging Oliver and crying, he was confused but frightened because of the blood. 
            I heard nothing but the sizzling of the chicken on the stove. 
<p>“Maria, I need to know what happened.” I whispered, keeping my eyes on the doorway, hoping whoever was in the other 
        room wouldn’t hear me. 
<p>Maria fumbled through her explanation. “I went to- You asked me to see what Velvet was barking at and she was barking 
        and- and then the door- I don’t know, the door just.. blew into the room and it almost hit me. It was so close 
        to hitting me but it hit Velvet instead and she went across the room so, so fast and then I looked out the doorway
        and there was something there, I don’t know what it was but it was big, it was so big. I..” She stopped speaking,
        but continued a few moments later. “I don’t- I don’t know what that is.” I was concerned.
<p>She didn’t know what it was? A bear maybe? Why would it blow down the door? Could a grizzly do something like that? 
        First I had to get the kids to safety. I turned to them, Oliver looked like a shell of fear and Maria sobbed as
        she clutched him.

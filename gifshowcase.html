    <div> <img src=Images/motorcycle.gif
                   alt="An animation of a motorcycle passing by on a road."
                   width="300px" height="auto">
                   </div>
        <p style=padding-bottom:60px>This animation unlike the others, was very difficult to do. Out of these first three, this one took me the
        longest to finish. I knew I wanted to play with perspective and a moving camera angle, I also wanted the camera to move somewhat quickly 
        to follow the motorcycle. I like the vibe of vehicle lights at night time, and I had never done a drawing or animation with a black background
        before this one, so I decided to go for it. I used Procreate for this, and I wanted this to be a mixture of calm with the lights driving by but
        it also has a lot of energy in it because of the speed of the motorcycle and the speed of the camera moving.</p>
    
    <div> <img src=Images/eye.gif
            alt="An animation of an eye with varying emotions."
            width="300px" height="auto">
</div>
        <p style=padding-bottom:60px>This is another animation I did for my project. This one was slightly difficult
            because of the transitions between emotions, neutral, surprise, anger, then a deep breath to calm down. I also had to figure out how to make each emotion
            stay there long enough to be recognizible. I love eyes and how much emotion they can show on their own. This 
            particular animation shows just how quickly emotions can change from one moment to the next. I also used Procreate for this.
        
    <div> <img src=Images/firework.gif 
            alt="An animation of a magical firework"
            width="300px" height="auto">
        </div>
        <p style=padding-bottom:60px> This is a quick animation I did of a small spec flying around that ended up exploding like a firework.
        It is a whimisical piece and has high energy and excitment. I used the procreate application to do the animation,
        and I have messed around with animating fireworks a couple times before so that previous knowledge helped me create this.</p>
